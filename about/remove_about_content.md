Writing software is creating logic models that a machine can execute. The interface between the programmer & the machine. Like writing, programming allows one to organize an ontology using abstractions. The executable software provides feedback on the logical consistency of the model. If there are logic issues, there are bugs. With tools such as type systems, tests, & validations, the software will result in errors. The discovery process allows you to explore conceptual systems. With a logic feedback loop revealing insights into Existence.
